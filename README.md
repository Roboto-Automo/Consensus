# Problem Statement
Do you and your friends ever struggle to decide on what to do on a night out? Have you ever had difficulty organising the perfect activity for your work colleagues? Well, our app 'Consensus' aims to address that.
'Consensus' is a web-app that enables a group of people to vote of their desired criteria for an activity and then let the app pick the final result.

It is a real-time voting app that applies filters based on the outcome of several rounds of voting. The end-result is a single suggestion made by the app.
